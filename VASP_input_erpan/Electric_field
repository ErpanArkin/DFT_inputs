when applying a homogeneous electric field using vasp:

1) higher precision
2) read wavecar and chgcar
3) if the system is charged, only cubic cell can be used

PREC = Med 
ISTART = 1
ICHARG = 1
IBRION = 1 #if relaxation is needed
EFIELD = 0.08           # strength of the field
IDIPOL = 2              # direction of the field
DIPOL = 0.5 0.5 0.5     # center of the field
LDIPOL=.TRUE.           # should be on whether the system is charged or not
NELECT = 497            # number of electrons for a charged system
