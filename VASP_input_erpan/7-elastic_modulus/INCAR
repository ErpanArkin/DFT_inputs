                      !+10, Adding ten to the value of ICHARG (e.g. using 11,12 or the less convenient value 10) means that the charge density will be kept constant during !the whole electronic minimization.

   EDIFFG =   -1.0E-07
   ADDGRID = .TRUE.
   ALGO   =   Fast  !electronic minimisation algorithm

                      !ALGO = Fast. mixture of both algorithm
                      !ALGO = Exact or ALGO = Diag (both IALGO = 90), an exact diagonalization
                      !ALGO = Eigenval (IALGO = 3) e.g. read from WAVECAR, allows to recalculate one electron energies, density of state and perform selected postprocessing using the current orbitals  
                      !ALGO = None or ALGO = Nothing (IALGO = 2) e.g. read from WAVECAR, allows to recalculate the density of states (eigenvalues from WAVECAR, e.g. !using different smearing or tetrahedron method) or perform other selected postprocessing using the current orbitals and one electron energies 
   LORBIT =   0      !default 0, If the LORBIT flag is not equal zero, the site and l-projected density of states is also calculated.
                      !partial DOS projected onto molecular orbitals, creates PROCAR
                      !(LORBIT=1, 2) projecting the orbitals onto spherical harmonics that are non-zero within spheres of a radius RWIGS                          around each ion
